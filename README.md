# VulkanEngine

A basic renderer using Vulkan and GLSL. Its main goal is for me to be able to learn and play around with various graphics techniques.

## Implemented Features
- PBR using the Cook-Torrance BRDF
- IBL
- Soft PCF shadows for directional lights
- A basic render graph to make adding renderpasses easier and to automatically add the needed synchronization
- Bindless rendering
- ECS using Flecs
